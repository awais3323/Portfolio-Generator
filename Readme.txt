This portofolio is made with HTML5 and CSS3 by "Awais Zahid".

----------------> run the code and press (  CTRL + P ) for the print

--> A person with bit knowledge of both of these language can easily use this CODE TEMPLATE

                                (((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((NOTE))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
-> if you run the code directly on your browser from any device then the ouput wil sure be with absurd the whole alignment and design
will have no sense print it on (A4 paper) or make the pdf of it then the resume / cv will be in his actual shape.
-> (Again) the code is perfectly and precisely designed for one page if you want to take it to other pages then go ahead it will affect 
the design
-> content entered in the resume / cv must be precise. if you add more than the limit then the length will increase from one pages to more.


Programming Languages: you can set the name of the language your time experience in months and years and set the progress bar according to it (IN CSS)

Color theme: if you dont like the color scheme then just simple change the color in the {.root{}}. {Note: BLue color is known as a relaxing and calm color that's 
why it is used as default }

font size: you can manage the size as well {note: the font-size that has been set as deafult is best for holding the viewer for a second}.
==> the purpose of making such portofolio was to do something impressive that will let viewer to hold op for a second and have a thorough view you 
can delete the stuff as well as add stuff according to your need.

if you like the idea and resume then apppreciate the work and give me the credit as well

thanks
